# Freeki Games Auto Answerer

Wizard101, that is all (also i cobbled it together in a few hours)

Quiz questions that are in the script are automatically selected and submitted. Quiz questions that are not in the script are not.

At the end of the quiz, where it shows the score, the script will automatically upload the answers to me so I can add them to the script.

# For Developers?

To prune the questions list of duplicates, run "freeki.py prune"  
To build the script, run "freeki.py build"  
To do both, run "freeki.py all"
